    abstract = { This article considers simulation and analysis of incidence data using stochastic compartmental models in well-mixed populations. Several simulation approaches are described and compared. Thereafter, we provide an overview of likelihood estimation for stochastic models. We apply one such method to a real-life outbreak data set and compare models assuming different kinds of stochasticity. We also give references for other publications where detailed information on this topic can be found. }
