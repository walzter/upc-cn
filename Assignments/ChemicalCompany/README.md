# Readme for the Chemical Company Project 

## Comments from the presentation 
- Show the exact use-cases 
- Implement Inference methods 
- Change the coloring of the nodes of the graph (if using Materials & Processes) 
- 

## Modeling 
- Convert the graph into a probabilistic model in order to make inference 
- Also add algorithms to detect "oportunities" 
	- Opportunities are: 
		- Outputs which can be used for another input 
		- Inputs which are outputs of other processes 
		- Outputs / Inputs which are not required/ are alone
